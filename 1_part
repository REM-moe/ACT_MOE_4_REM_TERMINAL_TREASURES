I approached the desk, my eyes scanning the items Caesar had left behind. A penholder with pens neatly arranged, a computer humming softly, and a calculator that seemed to beckon my attention. Its keys were stained with dried blood, an ominous detail that hinted at a hidden message.

With cautious fingers, I switched on the calculator. The screen flickered to life, revealing a sequence: 87 72 89 95 66 82 79 84 72 69 82.

My mind raced, recognizing the potential significance of this coded message.

“If it were to be his last message, it might point to the Killer.”

With my expertise in encoding, I cracked the code. It was a message.

“Chuck”, I called out, excitement in my voice. “You need to see this. We have a breakthrough.”
